Assistance Request Form - Unite Us Frontend Project
Aaron Berns

## Description

This project uses React to implement an Assistance Request form that allows a user to enter their first and last name, email address, the service required, and a description of their needs. Service options are fetched from the provided API. After field validation, the form is submitted to the API and a successful response results in the hiding of the form to prevent duplicate submissions and the display of the response message. Unsuccessful response messages are displayed as alerts to allow for repeated submission attempts.

## Languages and Tools

- React 16, create-react-app for UI and logic
- React hooks replace class components
- Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Bootstrap 3 for basic styling
- Jest and Enzyme for testing

## Requirements

Node and React are required for running the application locally. The standard scripts can be used and are detailed below. The given API must be running locally. Docker was used during development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
